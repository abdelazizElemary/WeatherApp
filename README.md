# WeatherApp
A node.js application that takes user location and detect the forecast through integrating the web app with api services.

**In this application**

* I used node.js express in the backend
* Adjusting a good looking interface but not with animations and stuff
* Used javascript ES6 Aside object property destructuring and shorthand
* Handled all the backend issues to make sure of the website reliability
